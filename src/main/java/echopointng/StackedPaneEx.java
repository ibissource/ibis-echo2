/**
 * <code>StackedContentPaneEx</code> is a <code>{@link Pane}</code> that is allowed to have
 * multiple children with only one child component is show at a time, the one
 * that is on top of the '<b>stack</b>'. Think of it like a deck of cards,
 * only the top card is visible at the one time, even though there can be many
 * cards in the deck.
 * <p>
 * When <code>StackedContentPaneEx</code> is "pushed", a new child is placed
 * on top of the display "stack" and made visible. When the
 * <code>StackedContentPaneEx</code> is "popped" the previous child in the
 * 'stack' is displayed.
 * <p>
 * The StackedPane by default does "lazy" rendering. This means that the
 * components are only rendered on the client as required. This means less
 * client memory and network usage but also means the render time for moving
 * between displayed child components is higher. You can turn this off to 
 * improve the "transition" time between components.
