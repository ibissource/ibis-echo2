/**
 * This interface is called by the Tree rendering code to retrieve named
 * icon images.  These icons are sued to provide visuals such as the lines 
 * between tree nodes and expnasion handles. The <code>TreeIcons</code> interface
 * can be used by <code>TreeCellRenderer</code> objects to obtain default 
 * icons for "parent" and "leaf" nodes in the Tree.
 * <p>
 * The tree will ask for nodes with the following names :
 * <p>
 * ICON_PLUS			- the expanding + for normal nodes with children <br>
 * ICON_PLUSBOTTOM		- the expanding + for the last node of a parent node<br>
 * ICON_MINUS			- the contracting - for normal nodes with children<br>
 * ICON_MINUSBOTTOM 	- the contracting - for the last node of a parent node<br>
 * ICON_FOLDER			- a folder icon for closed nodes with children<br>
 * ICON_FOLDEROPEN		- a folder icon for opened nodes with children<br>
 * ICON_JOIN			- a joiner line icon for a normal nodes<br>
 * ICON_JOINEBOTTOM		- a joiner line icon for the last node of a parent node<br> 
 * ICON_JOINENOLINE		- a joiner icon for normal nodes when no lines awre required<br>
 * ICON_LEAF			- a leaf icon for nodes with no children<br>
 * ICON_LINE			- a line icon between nodes<br>
 * ICON_EMPTY			- a empty icon between nodes<br>
 * ICON_ROOT			- a root icon<br>
 * ICON_ROOTOPEN		- a root open icon<br>
