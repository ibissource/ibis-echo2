 * The <code>TreeModel</code> interface defines a suitable data model for a <code>Tree</code>.

 * Tree gaurantees not to call any of the <code>getChildXXX()</code> methods until they
 * are absolutely needed (for example a parent node is expanded).  
 * <p>
 * This is to allow children to be lazily created "as needed".  Ths is useful for
 * very large TreeModels or ones where child node creation is an expensive operation
 * <p>
 * Note that the <code>isLeaf() </code> may be called at any time and if
 * it returns true, then the node cannot contain any child nodes.  However the inverse if not
 * necessarily true.  A model may return that a node is NOT a leaf but it may still 
 * have zero child nodes.
