 * A <code>Floatable</code> is a component that can be "floated" to the left or right within another component.
 * Adjacent components will flow down the right side of a left-floated box and down the left side of a right-floated
 * box.
 * <p>
 * A Floatable may also "clear" adjacent floated Components. Setting the clearFloat property will ensure that the
 * Component will be rendered on a new line from adjacent floated Components.
 * <p>
