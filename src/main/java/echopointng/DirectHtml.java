 * <code>DirectHtml</code> is a very lightweight component that will insert
 * HTML text directly onto the client. Unlike TemplatePanel, this component will
 * <b>NOT</b> validate this HTML text nor will it parse the source HTML and perform
 * component or text substiutions.
 * <p>
 * This makes it more <i>lightweight</i> than TemplatePanel but far <i>less functional</i>
 * <p>
 * NOTE : The base <code>nextapp.echo2.app.Component</code> properties such as
 * background, foreground and font are NOT applied to this component.  You
 * must implement this in the HTML text itself.
 * <p>
 * Also be careful of your use of <i>id</i> attributes as they may clash with
 * Echo2 generated ones.
