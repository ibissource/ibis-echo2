/**
 * Defines the data model used by components like ProgressBars and Sliders.
 * <p>
 * Defines four interrelated integer properties: minimum, maximum, extent and
 * value. These four integers define two nested ranges like this: <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * minimum &lt;= value &lt;= value + extent &lt;= maximum
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </blockquote> The outer range is <code>minimum,maximum</code> and the inner
 * range is <code>value,value+extent</code>. The inner range must lie within
 * the outer one, i.e. <code>value</code> must be less than or equal to
 * <code>maximum</code> and <code>value+extent</code> must greater than or
 * equal to <code>minimum</code>, and <code>maximum</code> must be greater
 * than or equal to <code>minimum</code>.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>The minimum and maximum set methods "correct" the other three properties
 * to acommodate their new value argument. For example setting the model's
 * minimum may change its maximum, value, and extent properties (in that order),
 * to maintain the constraints specified above.
 * 
 * <li>The value and extent set methods "correct" their argument to fit within
 * the limits defined by the other three properties. For example if
 * <code>value == maximum</code>,<code>setExtent(10)</code> would change
 * the extent (back) to zero.
 *
