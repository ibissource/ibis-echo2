 * and go forwards (ie redo some actions).

	 * This is a unique <code>history hash </code> value that can be used to uniquely identify
	 * this particular slice of application state.  This method should follow the same semantics
	 * as <code>Object.hashCode()</code> especially in regards to how it acts when used as the 
	 * key of a <code>java.util.Map</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * The value used be will be display to the user on their browser as indication of where they are 
	 * inside the application.  Therefore there are some size contrictions on the length of this string
	 * which is the maximum size of a URL parameter in the users browser.  To be safe use fairly compact 
	 * strings (< 256 chars say)
	 * <p>
	 * This is method is defined as a String to allow more meaningful state to be displayed
	 * and also to allow possible "encoding" of application state in the hashCode itself.
	 * <p>
	 * The most trivial implementation fo this method would be
	 * <pre>
	 *    public String historyHash() {
	 *       return String.valueOf(this.hashCode());
	 *    }

	 * <pre>
	 * public String historyHash() {
	 *    return whatAreWeDoing + "-" + System.identityHashCode(new Object());
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * @return - a unique history hash code
