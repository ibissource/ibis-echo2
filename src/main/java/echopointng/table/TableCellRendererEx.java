/**
 * <code>TableCellRendererEx</code> is an extension of
 * <code>TableCellRenderer</code> that allows cell content other than
 * <code>Component</code>s to be expressed as well as allowing row and column
 * spanning by table cells.
 * <p>
 * This is acheived by the <code>TableCellRendererEx</code> returning
 * <code>TableLayoutDataEx</code> objects that can describe the content and
 * visual appearance of the table cell.
 * <p>
 * Using strings for cell contents results in less memory being used because a
 * Component need not be stored per table cell.
 * <p>
 * It is expected that uses of this class such as TableEx will call the
 * <code>TableCellRenderer.getTableCellRendererComponent()</code> method first
 * and if it returns null then the
 * <code>TableCellRendererEx.getTableCellRendererLayout()</code> method will
 * then be called.
