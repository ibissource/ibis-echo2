/**
 * <code>AbleProperties</code> is a collection of UI properties that are related to the
 * various *.able interfaces. This allows you to specify many individual
 * properties in one object.
 * <p>
 * This class is really design to be used NOT as a fully fledged component in its own right
 * but rather as a holder of specific properties.  Being derived from <code>Component</code> allows
 * it to re-use much of the Style/Property/Rendering code infrastructure of Echo2.
 * <p>
 * Because <code>AbleProperties</code> is ultimately derived from
 * <code>Component</code>, then you can set properties in here via
 * <code>Style</code> objects. However to get full <code>StyleSheet</code> support,
 * the <code>AbleProperties</code> must be part of the Echo2 component
 * hiearchy.
