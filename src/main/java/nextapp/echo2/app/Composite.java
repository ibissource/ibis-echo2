 * Generic composite component base class.  
 * This class is intended to be used as base class for composite components.
 * This component will simply display its content without any modification to
 * its appearance or behavior.  This component may have at most one child
 * component.
 * <p>
 * See the <code>Panel</code> component for a default implementation of a 
 * single-child container component.

 * This class provides no benefit if you are providing a custom client/server
 * synchronization peer.  If you wish to create a component with a custom
 * client/server synchronization peer, <code>Component</code> itself should be
 * derived instead of this class.
