 * <code>DomUpdateSupport</code> which enables rendering hierarchies of
 * components directly to (X)HTML code.  The optional 
 * <code>ActionProcessor</code> and <code>InputProcessor</code> interfaces

 * a particular class of <code>Component</code>.  Thus, it is not possible to
 * store information about a component's state in this object (in contrast
 * to Echo v1.x, where a peer was created for each component instance).  Such 
 * rendering state information should now be stored in the 
 * <code>ContainerInstance</code>, see the
